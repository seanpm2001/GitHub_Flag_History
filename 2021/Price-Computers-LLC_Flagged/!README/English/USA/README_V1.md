# Price Computers LLC Flagged

On 2021 June 10th, I created an account for [`@price-computers-LLC`](https://github.com/Price-computers-LLC/) the company that had previously repaired my laptop. I planned to donate it to them, as to prevent cybersquatting. The account was suspended suspended 13 days after creation (On 2021 June 23rd) the account was created with the intent to hand it over to a company, but it was flagged before I could give it to them. No repeal has been sent to date.

On 2022 July 29th, I got some badly cropped images, as GitHub is refusing to let me download the repository (I waited nearly an hour for it to download, only to end up with a corrupted zip file) or separate image files due to my ongoing flag. They are placeholders for now.

I do not intend to repeal unless asked.
